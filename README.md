<li> Part 2: Applying Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and t-SNE</li>
<li> Part 3: Performing a Cluster Analysis with K-means</li>
<li> Part 4: Making Recommendations</li>



<br>

## Answers to the questions:  

<b> Are there distinct clusters?</b><br>
Within the dimentionality reduction, using PCA no visible clusters were found. The patients in this data set could not be clustered. <br>

##  <b>Reccomendations: </b>

The results of the PCA test was inconclusive, more data is needed to make any determinations.
