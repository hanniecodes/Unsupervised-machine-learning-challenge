## Unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
<br>
<b><u>I completed this challenge by following the following steps:</b><</u> <br>

<li> Part 1: Preparing the Data</li>
<li> Part 2: Applying Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and t-SNE</li>
<li> Part 3: Performing a Cluster Analysis with K-means</li>
<li> Part 4: Making Recommendations</li>

## Answers to the questions: 
<br>
<b> Are there distinct clusters?</b><br>
Within the dimentionality reduction, using PCA no visible clusters were found. The patients in this data set could not be clustered. <br>

<b> Determine where the elbow of the plot is, and at which value of k it appears.</b><br>
The value of k in which the elbow appears is 3. <br>

<b> Reccomendations:</b><br>
The results of the PCA test was inconclusive, more data is needed to make any determinations.
